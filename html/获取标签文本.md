# innerHTML vs nodeValue vs textContent vs innerText
1. innerHTML parses content as HTML, so it takes longer.
2. nodeValue uses straight text, does not parse HTML, and is faster.
    - element的nodeValue返回null, 不会自动获取子代textnode的text
## 3. textContent uses straight text, does not parse HTML, and is faster.(默认使用textContent)
    - If the node is a document or a Doctype, textContent returns null
    - If the node is a CDATA section, comment, processing instruction, or text node, textContent returns the text inside the node, i.e., the Node.nodeValue.
    - For other node types, textContent returns the concatenation of the textContent of every child node, excluding comments and processing instructions. (This is an empty string if the node has no children.)
    - textContent gets the content of all elements, including `<script>` and `<style>` elements.
4. innerText Takes styles into consideration. It won't get hidden text for instance.
    - Moreover, since innerText takes CSS styles into account, reading the value of innerText **triggers a reflow** to ensure up-to-date computed styles. (Reflows can be computationally expensive, and thus should be avoided when possible.)
